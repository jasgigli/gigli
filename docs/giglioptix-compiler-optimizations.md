# GigliOptix Compiler Optimization Recommendations

## 1. Dead Code Elimination
- Remove unused variables, functions, and imports during compilation.

## 2. Tree Shaking
- Only include code and components that are actually used in the final WASM bundle.

## 3. Function Inlining
- Inline small, frequently called functions to reduce call overhead and improve performance.

## 4. Minification
- Minify the generated WASM binary to reduce download size.

## 5. Memory Layout Optimization
- Arrange data structures for linear memory access to maximize cache efficiency.
- Use compact representations for common types (e.g., Option, Result).

## 6. Reactivity Compilation
- Compile `$:` reactive blocks to minimal, dependency-tracked update code, similar to Svelte's approach.

## 7. Scoped CSS Compilation
- Compile component styles to static, scoped CSS rules to avoid runtime style computation.

## 8. WASM-Specific Optimizations
- Use WASM SIMD and threading where available for performance-critical code.
- Avoid dynamic memory allocation in hot paths.
- Prefer stack allocation for short-lived data.

## 9. Import/Export Minimization
- Only expose necessary functions and data to JavaScript interop.

## 10. Startup Time Reduction
- Precompute static data at compile time.
- Minimize runtime initialization logic.

## 11. Debug/Release Modes
- Provide debug info and checks in development builds, but strip them from production builds for minimal WASM size.
